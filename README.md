# U-Paris-Box

U-Paris-Box is a vulnerable machine designed by two students who are in master 1 cybersecurity of the University of Paris, **FALL Abdou Aziz** and **AMEURLAIN Abdelaziz** under the supervision of Professor **OSMAN Salem**.
The file U_Paris_Box.ovf is the machine you can export to VMware and do your penetration test quietly. If you get stuck, we wrote an article on how to exploit the machine and you can find it on hackin9. Don't forget to try it first before reading the article, that's how we progress.
